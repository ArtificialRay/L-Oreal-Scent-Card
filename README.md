Here is a simulation demo of my group project: L'Oreal Scent Card for 2023 L'Oreal BrandStorm competition, including a introduction Pdf, prototype of Scent card app, and a simulation of Scent Card genration via python and mysql. 

# Introduction PDF
please find **scentCard.pdf** to view our project intro, if you merely want to know how the Scent Card app works, turns to page 2

# Scent card app prototype
Since this prototype is supported by axure rp10, you can click the link to view the prototype:\

this link is also added in repository

# Simulation code
Core function of app: Scent Card generation is implemented by Python, you can find the source code: **ScentCardChain.py** and **technical document: ScentCardChain.ipynb** to see how it works. \
Funtions of source code include:
* Scent card generation through blockchain(Hash-chain: a linked-list like data structure)
* input and output the Scent card your create
* add Scent card information to your MySQL database(which is a distributed ledger for every miners)
* find your Scent card through NFT Code(Hash code in program)

please enjoy the project !! Feel free to give me feedback(good or bad are both okay) if the Scent Card can really catch your eyes~
